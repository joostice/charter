Charter of Joostice
===

We shall be transparent in all our financial dealings, unless such
transparency would pose a threat to life or liberty.

We shall engage in business ethically, thoughtfully and sustainably. We will
insist on the same throughout our supply chain.

We value ascetic principles of simplicity and fulfilment, placing social needs
ahead of our own individual needs.

We support the value of a healthy democracy and avenues for dissent.

We value both the wisdom of a collective group and the need for pragmatic
action.
